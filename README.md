The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to train machine learning models using common QSAR techniques.
You will need to know how to:

- [ ] Manipulate Pandas dataframes of chemical data
- [ ] Compute features and fingerprints using RDKit and Mordred
- [ ] Compare model performance using cross-validation tests

As you complete these assignments, you will also learn important points about feature selection and importance methods as well as understand tradeoffs between general vs specific featurizations and different ML algorithms.
